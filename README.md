Setup Instructions
------------------
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd <your-repo-name>
2. Open the Project:
   - No additional setup is required since this is a static website.
   - Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the website locally:
     open index.html
   - Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension) for a better development experience.
3. Customize Content:
   - Update the profile image in index.html by replacing the src attribute of the .hero-image with your own image URL or local file path.
   - Modify the contact information in the #contact section to reflect your details.
   - Update the project details in the #projects section with your own project information and links.
   - Adjust the links in .hero-btns (Resume, LinkedIn, GitHub) and footer social links with your actual URLs.
4. Deploy (Optional):
   - Deploy the website to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other static hosting service by uploading the project files.
   - Ensure all external resources (Font Awesome, Google Fonts, images) are accessible.

File Structure
--------------
portfolio-website/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css         # CSS styles for the website
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js         # JavaScript for interactivity and animations
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation

Usage
-----
- Navigate through the sections (Home, Skills, Project, Contact) using the header navigation.
- On mobile devices, click the hamburger menu to access the navigation links.
- Use the contact form to send messages (requires backend setup for full functionality, currently static).
- Click the project buttons to view a live demo or GitHub repository of the showcased project.


Troubleshooting
---------------
- Profile Image Not Loading: Ensure the src URL in .hero-image is valid and accessible. Replace it with a local image if needed.
- Animations Not Working: Check if script.js is correctly linked in index.html and there are no console errors. Verify that the browser supports the animations (modern browsers recommended).
- External Resources Not Loading: Ensure an active internet connection to load Font Awesome and Google Fonts CDNs. Alternatively, download and host these resources locally.
- Responsive Issues: Test on multiple devices and screen sizes. Adjust the media queries in style.css if needed.

Future Improvements
-------------------
- Add a backend to handle the contact form submissions (e.g., using PHP or Node.js).
- Include more projects in the projects section with a carousel or grid layout.
- Add dark mode support for better accessibility.
- Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance.



Note: What Was the Most Interesting or Challenging Part of This Task?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The most challenging part of this task was troubleshooting the visibility issues in the hero section of the portfolio website. Initially, the profile image and buttons (Resume, LinkedIn, GitHub) were not rendering on the page despite the text being visible. This required a deep dive into the CSS to identify potential conflicts with the fade-in animation, z-index stacking, and opacity settings. Adjusting the background brightness of the hero section was also interesting, as it involved fine-tuning the gradient overlay to balance aesthetics with content readability, ensuring the design remained visually appealing while making the foreground elements stand out.
